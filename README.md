# CPP-Array #Assign 10
Check if the sum of a subarray within a given range is a perfect square or not
Given an array arr[] of size N and an array range[], the task is to check if the sum of the subarray {range[0],
.. , range[1]} is a perfect square or not. If the sum is a perfect square, then print the square root of the sum.
Otherwise, print -1.
Input: arr[] = {2, 19, 33, 48, 90, 100}, range = [1, 3]
Output: 10
Explanation: The sum of element from position 1 to position 3 is 19 + 33 + 48 = 100, which is a perfect
square of 10.
Input: arr[] = {13, 15, 30, 55, 87}, range = [0, 1]
Output: -1
